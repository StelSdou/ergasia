    "History": "As the story goes ... Once up a time, a long time ago, there were two brothers named Epimetheus and Prometheus. They were good gods. They had good hearts. They were good friends. One day, Prometheus got in trouble with Zeus. Angry over something or other, Zeus had declared that man did not deserve fire. Because he had a kind heart, and he knew how much man needed fire for food and warmth, Prometheus gave man the secret of fire even though Zeus had told all the gods not to do that. Zeus was furious that his order had been ignored. As punishment, Zeus chained Prometheus to a rock for many years. But that was not enough punishment, not for Zeus. Once Prometheus was chained to a rock, Zeus went after Prometheus\u0027 brother, the gentle, kind-hearted Epimetheus. Zeus did not chain Epimetheus to a rock. Zeus had a more sneaky punishment in mind. First, Zeus ordered the gods\u0027 handyman, the maker of things - Hephaestus - to make Zeus a daughter. Hephaestus made a woman out of clay, a beautiful woman. He brought her to life, and then brought her to Zeus. Zeus named his lovely new daughter Pandora. Zeus knew that Epimetheus was lonely. Zeus told Epimetheus that his brother, Hephaestus, had to be punished and that\u0027s why he was chained to a rock, but he felt sorry that this punishment left Epimetheus without the company of his brother. That\u0027s why Zeus had decided to give Pandora in marriage to Epimetheus. It was not the truth of course, but then nearly everyone in the ancient Greek world knew better than to believe the mighty Zeus.  Epimetheus was kind-hearted and gentle and thoughtful, but he was no fool. He knew Zeus was up to something. But he loved Pandora at first sight. Zeus gave the newlyweds a gift. Some say it was a jar. Some say it was a box. Whatever it was, it was locked. It came with a note. The note said:"

    "History": "It all started with Pandora box. You probably already know the story of Pandora, but you might not know what happened next. Pandora\u0027s box caused more problems! After the box was opened,  Zeus was horrified at what he saw happening. He saw fights and riots and wars and murders. Even though it was Zeus himself who had loaded Pandora\u0027s box with all kinds of terrible things, Zeus was determined to punish mankind for the terrible behavior he saw, which was quite unfair, but that had never stopped Zeus before. Zeus decided man had to go. Man was a mistake. Zeus ordered the waters to rise and flood the earth. Much to his satisfaction, everyone drowned, everyone except the gods, and all the half-gods and nymphs and other magical creatures, and all the Greek monsters who were still alive before the flood, and all the animals and all the plants. He just wanted people punished and they drowned, all except King Deucalion, who was considered the most honest man on earth, and the king\u0027s wife, Pyrrha. Thanks to the gossips, the god Prometheus heard about Zeus\u0027 plan to kill all mortal men and women. He did not doubt the rumors. As soon as he heard, the god Prometheus warned King Deucalion that a flood was coming. This was the same Prometheus who had given mankind the gift of fire. Not only did Prometheus have a kind heart, but King Deucalion was Prometheus\u0027 son. He knew his son would be safe because he was half a god, but his son\u0027s wife was a mortal. Prometheus knew how much his son loved his mortal wife. Prometheus told his son to build a sturdy boat and stock it well. His son knew that Prometheus could see into the future. (He also knew his father had trouble explaining what he saw in his visions.) King Deucalion listened very carefully."

    "Title": "How Aphrodite Caused the Trojan War ",
    "History": "The ancient Greek goddess of Love and Beauty, Aphrodite, showed up one day, thousands of years ago, and began appearing in ancient Greek myths, the myths told by the ancient Greek storytellers. According to the stories that sprang up about her, she was as vain as she was beautiful, and she was very beautiful. Zeus was delighted to claim her as his daughter. It was Zeus\u0027 habit to give his children titles and jobs. He gave Aphrodite the title of Goddess of Love and Beauty, and the job of spreading love and beauty everywhere. Aphrodite had a son, Eros (known as Cupid in Roman mythology) whom she loved dearly. She had a husband, the handyman to the gods, Hephaestus, whom she tolerated. She even got along with Hera, Queen of all the Greek gods, most of the time. She worked very hard at the job Zeus had given her as the goddess of love and beauty. Aphrodite tried to be nice to everyone, usually, and tried to spread love and beauty everywhere she went. But unfortunately, her plans for people (and gods and goddesses) did not always work out the way she thought they would, which caused no end of trouble. As Aphrodite often insisted, the things that went wrong were not really her fault. Not really. According to Helen, the Queen of Sparta, it was Aphrodite\u0027s vanity that caused the Trojan War. But Aphrodite would tell you the whole thing was Helen\u0027s fault. Whose fault was it really? Decide for yourself as you read this ancient Greek myth: What really caused the Trojan War "

    "History": "Once upon a time, a long time ago, there lived a king named Minos. King Minos lived on a lovely island called Crete. King Minos had everything a king could possibly want. Now and then, King Minos sent his navy to the tiny village of Athens, across the sea. The king of Athens did not know what to do. He was desperate. He figured if he had some time, he could build a strong navy, strong enough to send King Minos packing the next time he attacked Athens. The king of Athens offered King Minos a deal. If he would not attack Athens for 9 years, Athens would send 7 boys and 7 girls to the island of Crete to be eaten by the awful monster that King Minos kept as a pet, the dreaded minotaur. The minotaur lived in the heart of a maze on the island of Crete. King Minos loved that old monster. King Minos only attacked Athens when he was bored. He really didn\u0027t want anything. This way, his beloved monster could look forward to a special treat every 9 years or so. King Minos took the deal. Although Athens did build a navy, King Minos did not attack as the king of Athens had expected. In fact, King Minos kept his word. And now it was time for Athens to keep theirs.  Everyone in Athens was crying. Prince Theseus of Athens knew the importance of keeping your word. He knew that a deal was a deal. But, he was also quite sure that it was wrong to send small children to be eaten by a monster. Prince Theseus told his father (the king) that he was going to Crete as the seventh son of Athens. He was going to kill the Minotaur and end the terror."

    "History": "Once upon a time, there was an ancient city on the coast of Turkey named Troy. It was located across the Aegean Sea from the Greek city-state of Sparta. When the king of Sparta heard that his wife, the beautiful Helen, had been kidnapped by a prince of Troy, he called on the other Greek city-states to help him get her back. His call was answered. A thousand Greek ships set sail for Troy. The city of Troy was protected by a high wall built around the city. Some parts of the wall were 20 feet high! There were gates in the wall to let people in and out but it provided great defense for the people of Troy. It gave the Trojan warriors a relatively safe place to stand, while they rained arrows down on the people below, who were trying to break into the city. At the time of this story, Greek warriors had been trying to breach the wall around Troy for about ten years. The Greeks could not find a way in, and the Trojans did not seem able to drive the Greeks away. Things looked pretty hopeless until Odysseus, a famous ancient Greek general, thought of a trick. It was the custom back then to leave a peace offering behind to admit defeat. Odysseus suggested the Greeks build a huge, heavy, beautiful wooden horse, and leave it outside the gates of Troy. Then, the entire Greek army would pretend to leave, as if they were headed for home. But it was a trick. The horse would be hollow. Thirty men would be hiding inside. The very best Greek artists got busy carving the giant wooden horse, adding great detail, because everything in the Greek world had to be as beautiful as possible. When it was done, the Greek warriors pretended to sail away, leaving the horse behind. The people of Troy rushed outside, cheering their victory! They dragged the heavy horse inside the city gates and put it on display, which is just what the Greek general thought they would do - gloat. That night, while the Trojan people were sleeping, the men hiding inside the wooden horse climbed out and opened the gates. The waiting Greek army entered Troy. That was the end of Troy.          "

The family did not have much money, but their home was always cozy and warm, and the children always had soup and bread to eat. They never went hungry. One year, there was a terribly cold winter, and Hansel and Gretel\u0027s mother became ill and died. In time the woodcutter married another woman, but she was not kind and gentle. She was cruel and selfish. She wanted to be rich, and she wanted to eat fancy foods like roast beef, mashed potatoes, peas, corn, lemon cakes, and exotic fruits from sunny lands. She was angry that they could only afford soup and bread for every meal."

    "History": "Once upon a time there was a prince who wanted to marry a princess; but she would have to be a real princess. He travelled all over the world to find one, but nowhere could he get what he wanted. There were princesses enough, but it was difficult to find out whether they were real ones. There was always something about them that was not as it should be. So he came home again and was sad, for he would have liked very much to have a real princess. One evening a terrible storm came on; there was thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in torrents. Suddenly a knocking was heard at the city gate, and the old king went to open it. It was a princess standing out there in front of the gate. But, good gracious! what a sight the rain and the wind had made her look. The water ran down from her hair and clothes; it ran down into the toes of her shoes and out again at the heels. And yet she said that she was a real princess. \u201CWell, we\u2019ll soon find that out,\u201D thought the old queen. But she said nothing, went into the bedroom, took all the bedding off the bedstead, and laid a pea on the bottom; then she took twenty mattresses and laid them on the pea, and then twenty eider-down beds on top of the mattresses. On this the princess had to lie all night. In the morning she was asked how she had slept. \u201COh, very badly!\u201D said she. \u201CI have scarcely closed my eyes all night. Heaven only knows what was in the bed, but I was lying on something hard, so that I am black and blue all over my body. It\u2019s horrible!\u201D Now they knew that she was a real princess because she had felt the pea right through the twenty mattresses and the twenty eider-down beds. Nobody but a real princess could be as sensitive as that. So the prince took her for his wife, for now he knew that he had a real princess; and the pea was put in the museum, where it may still be seen, if no one has stolen it. There, that is a true story.

    "Title": "The Brave Tin Soldier",
    "History": "There were once five-and-twenty tin soldiers, who were all brothers, for they had been made out of the same old tin spoon. They shouldered arms and looked straight before them, and wore a splendid uniform, red and blue. The first thing in the world they ever heard were the words, \u201CTin soldiers!\u201D uttered by a little boy, who clapped his hands with delight when the lid of the box, in which they lay, was taken off. They were given him for a birthday present, and he stood at the table to set them up. The soldiers were all exactly alike, excepting one, who had only one leg; he had been left to the last, and then there was not enough of the melted tin to finish him, so they made him to stand firmly on one leg, and this caused him to be very remarkable. The table on which the tin soldiers stood, was covered with other playthings, but the most attractive to the eye was a pretty little paper castle. Through the small windows the rooms could be seen. In front of the castle a number of little trees surrounded a piece of looking glass, which was intended to represent a transparent lake. Swans, made of wax, swam on the lake, and were reflected in it. All this was very pretty, but the prettiest of all was a tiny little lady, who stood at the open door of the castle; she, also, was made of paper, and she wore a dress of clear muslin, with a narrow blue ribbon over her shoulders just like a scarf. In front of these was fixed a glittering tinsel rose, as large as her whole face. The little lady was a dancer, and she stretched out both her arms, and raised one of her legs so high, that the tin soldier could not see it at all, and he thought that she, like himself, had only one leg. \u201CThat is the wife for me,\u201D he thought; \u201Cbut she is too grand, and lives in a castle, while I have only a box to live in, five-and-twenty of us altogether, that is no place for her. Still, I must try and make her acquaintance.\u201D Then he laid himself at full length on the table behind a snuffbox that stood upon it, so that he could peep at the little delicate lady, who continued to stand on one leg without losing her balance. When evening came, the other tin soldiers were all placed in the box, and the people of the house went to bed. Then the playthings began to have their own games together, to pay visits, to have sham fights, and to give balls. The tin soldiers rattled in their box; they wanted to get out and join the amusements, but they could not open the lid. The nutcrackers played at leapfrog, and the pencil jumped about the table. There was such a noise that the canary woke up and began to talk, and in poetry too. Only the tin soldier and the dancer remained in their places. She stood on tiptoe, with her legs stretched out, as firmly as he did on his one leg. He never took his eyes from her for even a moment. The clock struck twelve, and, with a bounce, up sprang the lid of the snuffbox; but, instead of snuff, there jumped up a little black goblin; for the snuffbox was a toy puzzle. \u201CTin soldier,\u201D said the goblin, \u201Cdon\u2019t wish for what does not belong to you.\u201D But the tin soldier pretended not to hear. \u201CVery well; wait till to-morrow, then,\u201D said the goblin. When the children came in the next morning, they placed the tin soldier in the window. Now, whether it was the goblin who did it, or the draught, is not known, but the window flew open, and out fell the tin soldier, heels overhead, from the third story, into the street beneath. It was a terrible fall; for he came head downwards, his helmet and his bayonet stuck in between the flagstones, and his one leg up in the air. The servant maid and the little boy went downstairs directly to look for him; but he was nowhere to be seen, although once they nearly trod upon him. If he had called out, \u201CHere I am,\u201D it would have been all right, but he was too proud to cry out for help while he wore a uniform. Presently it began to rain, and the drops fell faster and faster, till there was a heavy shower. When it was over, two boys happened to pass by, and one of them said, \u201CLook, there is a tin soldier. He ought to have a boat to sail in.\u201D So they made a boat out of a newspaper, and placed the tin soldier in it, and sent him sailing down the gutter, while the two boys ran by the side of it, and clapped their hands. Good gracious, what large waves arose in that gutter! and how fast the stream rolled on! for the rain had been very heavy. The paper boat rocked up and down and turned itself round sometimes so quickly that the tin soldier trembled; yet he remained firm; his countenance did not change; he looked straight before him and shouldered his musket. Suddenly the boat shot under a bridge which formed a part of a drain, and then it was as dark as the tin soldier\u2019s box. \u201CWhere am I going now?\u201D thought he. \u201CThis is the black goblin\u2019s fault, I am sure. Ah, well, if the little lady were only here with me in the boat, I should not care for any darkness.\u201D Suddenly there appeared a great water-rat, who lived in the drain. \u201CHave you a passport? \u201Casked the rat, \u201Cgive it to me at once.\u201D But the tin soldier remained silent and held his musket tighter than ever. The boat sailed on, and the rat followed it. How he did gnash his teeth and cry out to the bits of wood and straw, \u201CStop him, stop him; he has not paid toll, and has not shown his pass. \u201CBut the stream rushed on stronger and stronger. The tin soldier could already see daylight shining where the arch ended. Then he heard a roaring sound quite terrible enough to frighten the bravest man. At the end of the tunnel the drain fell into a large canal over a steep place, which made it as dangerous for him as a waterfall would be to us. He was too close to it to stop, so the boat rushed on, and the poor tin soldier could only hold himself as stiffly as possible, without moving an eyelid, to show that he was not afraid. The boat whirled round three or four times, and then filled with water to the very edge; nothing could save it from sinking. He now stood up to his neck in water, while deeper and deeper sank the boat, and the paper became soft and loose with the wet, till at last the water closed over the soldier\u2019s head. He thought of the elegant little dancer whom he should never see again, and the words of the song sounded in his ears: \u201CFarewell, warrior! ever brave, Drifting onward to thy grave.\u201D Then the paper boat fell to pieces, and the soldier sank into the water and immediately afterwards was swallowed up by a great fish. Oh, how dark it was inside the fish! A great deal darker than in the tunnel, and narrower too, but the tin soldier continued firm and lay at full length shouldering his musket. The fish swam to and from, making the most wonderful movements, but at last he became quite still. After a while, a flash of lightning seemed to pass through him, and then the daylight approached, and a voice cried out, \u201CI declare here is the tin soldier.\u201D The fish had been caught, taken to the market and sold to the cook, who took him into the kitchen and cut him open with a large knife. She picked up the soldier and held him by the waist between her finger and thumb and carried him into the room. They were all anxious to see this wonderful soldier who had travelled about inside a fish; but he was not at all proud. They placed him on the table, and\u2014how many curious things do happen in the world!\u2014there he was in the very same room from the window of which he had fallen, there were the same children, the same playthings, standing on the table, and the pretty castle with the elegant little dancer at the door; she still balanced herself on one leg, and held up the other, so she was as firm as himself. It touched the tin soldier so much to see her that he almost wept tin tears, but he kept them back. He only looked at her and they both remained silent. Presently one of the little boys took up the tin soldier and threw him into the stove. He had no reason for doing so, therefore it must have been the fault of the black goblin who lived in the snuffbox. The flames lighted up the tin soldier, as he stood, the heat was very terrible, but whether it proceeded from the real fire or from the fire of love he could not tell. Then he could see that the bright colors were faded from his uniform, but whether they had been washed off during his journey or from the effects of his sorrow, no one could say. He looked at the little lady, and she looked at him. He felt himself melting away, but he still remained firm with his gun on his shoulder. Suddenly the door of the room flew open, and the draught of air caught up the little dancer, she fluttered like a sylph right into the stove by the side of the tin soldier and was instantly in flames and was gone. The tin soldier melted down into a lump, and the next morning, when the maid servant took the ashes out of the stove, she found him in the shape of a little tin heart. But of the little dancer nothing remained but the tinsel rose, which was burnt black as a cinder.  "

    "Title": "The Emperor\u2019s New Suit",
    "History": "Many, many years ago lived an emperor, who thought so much of new clothes that he spent all his money in order to obtain them; his only ambition was to be always well dressed. He did not care for his soldiers, and the theatre did not amuse him; the only thing, in fact, he thought anything of was to drive out and show a new suit of clothes. He had a coat for every hour of the day; and as one would say of a king \u201CHe is in his cabinet,\u201D so one could say of him, \u201CThe emperor is in his dressing-room.\u201D The great city where he resided was very gay; every day many strangers from all parts of the globe arrived. One day two swindlers came to this city; they made people believe that they were weavers, and declared they could manufacture the finest cloth to be imagined. Their colours and patterns, they said, were not only exceptionally beautiful, but the clothes made of their material possessed the wonderful quality of being invisible to any man who was unfit for his office or unpardonably stupid. \u201CThat must be wonderful cloth,\u201D thought the emperor. \u201CIf I were to be dressed in a suit made of this cloth I should be able to find out which men in my empire were unfit for their places, and I could distinguish the clever from the stupid. I must have this cloth woven for me without delay.\u201D And he gave a large sum of money to the swindlers, in advance, that they should set to work without any loss of time. They set up two looms, and pretended to be very hard at work, but they did nothing whatever on the looms. They asked for the finest silk and the most precious gold-cloth; all they got they did away with, and worked at the empty looms till late at night. \u201CI should very much like to know how they are getting on with the cloth,\u201D thought the emperor. But he felt rather uneasy when he remembered that he who was not fit for his office could not see it. Personally, he was of opinion that he had nothing to fear, yet he thought it advisable to send somebody else first to see how matters stood. Everybody in the town knew what a remarkable quality the stuff possessed, and all were anxious to see how bad or stupid their neighbours were. \u201CI shall send my honest old minister to the weavers,\u201D thought the emperor. \u201CHe can judge best how the stuff looks, for he is intelligent, and nobody understands his office better than he.\u201D The good old minister went into the room where the swindlers sat before the empty looms. \u201CHeaven preserve us!\u201D he thought, and opened his eyes wide, \u201CI cannot see anything at all,\u201D but he did not say so. Both swindlers requested him to come near, and asked him if he did not admire the exquisite pattern and the beautiful colours, pointing to the empty looms. The poor old minister tried his very best, but he could see nothing, for there was nothing to be seen. \u201COh dear,\u201D he thought, \u201Ccan I be so stupid? I should never have thought so, and nobody must know it! Is it possible that I am not fit for my office? No, no, I cannot say that I was unable to see the cloth.\u201D \u201CNow, have you got nothing to say?\u201D said one of the swindlers, while he pretended to be busily weaving. \u201COh, it is very pretty, exceedingly beautiful,\u201D replied the old minister looking through his glasses. \u201CWhat a beautiful pattern, what brilliant colours! I shall tell the emperor that I like the cloth very much.\u201D \u201CWe are pleased to hear that,\u201D said the two weavers, and described to him the colours and explained the curious pattern. The old minister listened attentively, that he might relate to the emperor what they said; and so he did. Now the swindlers asked for more money, silk and gold-cloth, which they required for weaving. They kept everything for themselves, and not a thread came near the loom, but they continued, as hitherto, to work at the empty looms. Soon afterwards the emperor sent another honest courtier to the weavers to see how they were getting on, and if the cloth was nearly finished. Like the old minister, he looked and looked but could see nothing, as there was nothing to be seen. \u201CIs it not a beautiful piece of cloth?\u201D asked the two swindlers, showing and explaining the magnificent pattern, which, however, did not exist. \u201CI am not stupid,\u201D said the man. \u201CIt is therefore my good appointment for which I am not fit. It is very strange, but I must not let any one know it;\u201D and he praised the cloth, which he did not see, and expressed his joy at the beautiful colours and the fine pattern. \u201CIt is very excellent,\u201D he said to the emperor. Everybody in the whole town talked about the precious cloth. At last the emperor wished to see it himself, while it was still on the loom. With a number of courtiers, including the two who had already been there, he went to the two clever swindlers, who now worked as hard as they could, but without using any thread. \u201CIs it not magnificent?\u201D said the two old statesmen who had been there before. \u201CYour Majesty must admire the colours and the pattern.\u201D And then they pointed to the empty looms, for they imagined the others could see the cloth. \u201CWhat is this?\u201D thought the emperor, \u201CI do not see anything at all. That is terrible! Am I stupid? Am I unfit to be emperor? That would indeed be the most dreadful thing that could happen to me.\u201D \u201CReally,\u201D he said, turning to the weavers, \u201Cyour cloth has our most gracious approval;\u201D and nodding contentedly he looked at the empty loom, for he did not like to say that he saw nothing. All his attendants, who were with him, looked and looked, and although they could not see anything more than the others, they said, like the emperor, \u201CIt is very beautiful.\u201D And all advised him to wear the new magnificent clothes at a great procession which was soon to take place. \u201CIt is magnificent, beautiful, excellent,\u201D one heard them say; everybody seemed to be delighted, and the emperor appointed the two swindlers \u201CImperial Court weavers.\u201D The whole night previous to the day on which the procession was to take place, the swindlers pretended to work, and burned more than sixteen candles. People should see that they were busy to finish the emperor\u2019s new suit. They pretended to take the cloth from the loom, and worked about in the air with big scissors, and sewed with needles without thread, and said at last: \u201CThe emperor\u2019s new suit is ready now.\u201D The emperor and all his barons then came to the hall; the swindlers held their arms up as if they held something in their hands and said: \u201CThese are the trousers!\u201D \u201CThis is the coat!\u201D and \u201CHere is the cloak!\u201D and so on. \u201CThey are all as light as a cobweb, and one must feel as if one had nothing at all upon the body; but that is just the beauty of them.\u201D \u201CIndeed!\u201D said all the courtiers; but they could not see anything, for there was nothing to be seen. \u201CDoes it please your Majesty now to graciously undress,\u201D said the swindlers, \u201Cthat we may assist your Majesty in putting on the new suit before the large looking-glass?\u201D The emperor undressed, and the swindlers pretended to put the new suit upon him, one piece after another; and the emperor looked at himself in the glass from every side. \u201CHow well they look! How well they fit!\u201D said all. \u201CWhat a beautiful pattern! What fine colours! That is a magnificent suit of clothes!\u201D The master of the ceremonies announced that the bearers of the canopy, which was to be carried in the procession, were ready. \u201CI am ready,\u201D said the emperor. \u201CDoes not my suit fit me marvellously?\u201D Then he turned once more to the looking-glass, that people should think he admired his garments. The chamberlains, who were to carry the train, stretched their hands to the ground as if they lifted up a train, and pretended to hold something in their hands; they did not like people to know that they could not see anything. The emperor marched in the procession under the beautiful canopy, and all who saw him in the street and out of the windows exclaimed: \u201CIndeed, the emperor\u2019s new suit is incomparable! What a long train he has! How well it fits him!\u201D Nobody wished to let others know he saw nothing, for then he would have been unfit for his office or too stupid. Never emperor\u2019s clothes were more admired. \u201CBut he has nothing on at all,\u201D said a little child at last. \u201CGood heavens! listen to the voice of an innocent child,\u201D said the father, and one whispered to the other what the child had said. \u201CBut he has nothing on at all,\u201D cried at last the whole people. That made a deep impression upon the emperor, for it seemed to him that they were right; but he thought to himself, \u201CNow I must bear up to the end.\u201D And the chamberlains walked with still greater dignity, as if they carried the train which did not exist.

In the cold and gloom a poor little girl, bareheaded and barefoot, was walking through the streets. Of course when she had left her house she\u0027d had slippers on, but what good had they been? They were very big slippers, way too big for her, for they belonged to her mother. The little girl had lost them running across the road, where two carriages had rattled by terribly fast. One slipper she\u0027d not been able to find again, and a boy had run off with the other, saying he could use it very well as a cradle some day when he had children of his own. And so the little girl walked on her naked feet, which were quite red and blue with the cold. In an old apron she carried several packages of matches, and she held a box of them in her hand. No one had bought any from her all day long, and no one had given her a cent. Shivering with cold and hunger, she crept along, a picture of misery, poor little girl! The snowflakes fell on her long fair hair, which hung in pretty curls over her neck. In all the windows lights were shining, and there was a wonderful smell of roast goose, for it was New Year\u0027s eve. Yes, she thought of that! In a corner formed by two houses, one of which projected farther out into the street than the other, she sat down and drew up her little feet under her. She was getting colder and colder, but did not dare to go home, for she had sold no matches, nor earned a single cent, and her father would surely beat her. Besides, it was cold at home, for they had nothing over them but a roof through which the wind whistled even though the biggest cracks had been stuffed with straw and rags. Her hands were almost dead with cold. Oh, how much one little match might warm her! If she could only take one from the box and rub it against the wall and warm her hands. She drew one out. R-r-ratch! How it sputtered and burned! It made a warm, bright flame, like a little candle, as she held her hands over it; but it gave a strange light! It really seemed to the little girl as if she were sitting before a great iron stove with shining brass knobs and a brass cover. How wonderfully the fire burned! How comfortable it was! The youngster stretched out her feet to warm them too; then the little flame went out, the stove vanished, and she had only the remains of the burnt match in her hand. She struck another match against the wall. It burned brightly, and when the light fell upon the wall it became transparent like a thin veil, and she could see through it into a room. On the table a snow-white cloth was spread, and on it stood a shining dinner service. The roast goose steamed gloriously, stuffed with apples and prunes. And what was still better, the goose jumped down from the dish and waddled along the floor with a knife and fork in its breast, right over to the little girl. Then the match went out, and she could see only the thick, cold wall. She lighted another match. Then she was sitting under the most beautiful Christmas tree. It was much larger and much more beautiful than the one she had seen last Christmas through the glass door at the rich merchant\u0027s home. Thousands of candles burned on the green branches, and colored pictures like those in the printshops looked down at her. The little girl reached both her hands toward them. Then the match went out. But the Christmas lights mounted higher. She saw them now as bright stars in the sky. One of them fell down, forming a long line of fire."
